<h3>ICESym-GUI Help</h3>
<p>
<font color="red">ICESym (Internal Combustion Engine Simulator) </font> is a simulation software made of two independents components.
The first component is the numerical solver called ICESym-1d, and is written in three languages (Cython, C++
and Fortran) that work together (see ICESym-1d Programmers Guide). The second component is a Graphical
User Interface called ICESym GUI, and it allows at user to make simulations test easily and fast. Both can work
separately, but togheter they also, and any change must take place simultaneously in both programs to maintain
consistency, and thus allowing to run simulations from ICESym-GUI.

<br>
<p>
ICESym-GUI is written in Python and it uses a graphic library called wxPython, that is a blending of the wxWidgets
C++ class library with the Python programming language. Has two independents components. Pre-Process
Interface and Post-Process Interface. The first provides at user one space for make simulations graphically,
including components to the diagrams and setting theirs attributes in simple form. Post-Process provides tools
for see the results of the simulation, it is: make graphics, choosing name of variables, and a lot of differents
things.
