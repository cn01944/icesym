<h3> Plot Data in Pre-Process </h3>
ICESym-GUI allows see a plot XY for some attributes that have two columns. This attributes has a button a side that allows you do click and see the graphic. 
<br>
For example, <code>Cylinder -> Injection -> Mass Injected Rate</code> allows see its data. This's important because you can 
identify the law that you used in one click, inside ICESym-GUI, and you don't need export data to other software.
