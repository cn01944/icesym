<h3>Pre-process</h3>

<p>In Pre-Process module, you must configure your Simulation. </p>
<p>A lot of attributes is necessary setting. You can do this in easy way, because the Pre-process includes a graphical interfase to modeling your engine.
In the same way that the most important engines simulators software's, you can incorporate to the model components doing only one click. Moreover 
ICESym-GUI allows sets attributes in easiest way, you only must completing the TextBoxes, or selectioning RadioButtons or completing the tables importing data.</p>
<p>In this help section, you can read about what is each attribute of each component to understand how make your own simulation.</p>
<br>

<h5>Compatibility with ICESym-1D:</h5>
<p>You must remember that the simulations saved in ICESym-GUI pre-process automatically can be executed in ICESym-1D. </p>
<p>You only must execute in the ICESym-1d folder:
<br>
<br>
<code>$ python main.py</code>
<br> 
<br>
and indicates the filename that you saved when the python script was solicited. Preferently you need copy the file to the <code>src</code> path in ICESym-1D.
