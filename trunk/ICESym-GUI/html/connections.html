<h3> Connection Between Objects </h3>

Perhaps the most important operation to do is the connection between components. For an operational engine
model the first requeriment is the relation between its parts in a natural way. This natural way determines
what objects can be connected with what others.
<br><br>
Moreover exists others restrictions that limit the connections possibilities. For understand it, is necessary
understand how indicates the direction in the connection. Actually the form is the selection order. When the
user want to connect the objects, first must select the left object (left, not means left in the screen), and second
right click in the right object, in the simulation this means that the exhaust in the first object is intake in the
second object. But, be careful, that some object only can be connected with only one object. 
This system rules borns in the real engines, and can be resumed in the next table:

Example: <b> Connecting Objects </b>
<br>
<br>
In this example we shall to explain how connect the next simulation, composed for: Atmosphere-Tube-Atmosphere (for example, if we need verify the behavior of the flux in the tube when exists differents conditions in the intake atmosphere and the exhaust atmosphere).
<br>
<ul>
	<li><b>1 - </b>Create the three objects: two atmospheres and one tube (see the first image) <br><br><img src="images/connection1.png" title="Three Objects Created"/> <br></li>
	<li><b>2 - </b>Select the first Atmosphere and do right click over the Tube. This action will connect the objects.</li>
	<li><b>3 - </b>Select the Tube and do right click over the second Atmosphere. Now we have the connections required. <br><br><img src="images/connection2.png" title="Three Objects Connected" /><br></li>
	<li><b>4 - </b>For remove connections only select the line that represents the connection, and press "supr" key.</li>
</ul>
